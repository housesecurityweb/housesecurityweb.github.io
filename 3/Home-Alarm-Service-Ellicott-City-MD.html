<p>I explained that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store.
