<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well.

<p>The only real concern we have is with the cost. The plan isn't at all cheap in the first place, but if you want to keep 4K recordings in the cloud you'll need a higher-tier additional membership.
