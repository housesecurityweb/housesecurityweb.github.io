<p>You utilize a keypad to manually equip and disarm your home security system. Like the majority of wireless security equipment, keypads can be set up anywhere you want. A lot of wireless keypads are placed by the front door, but it does not need to be. You might desire numerous keypads if your home has multiple entrances that are frequently used, such as one by the front door and one in the garage, or if your home is multiple stories. The keypad allows you to enter your security code in case the alarm is set off while you are at home. Choose an accessible positioning that works for you.</p>

You don't need to enter a house to cut the wire with wireless," the way you would with wired security, cautions Du. Without taking the correct security safety measures, you might be leaving your home open to trespassers who can jam your system and enter your home without your sensors picking up their existence.</p>
