<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
