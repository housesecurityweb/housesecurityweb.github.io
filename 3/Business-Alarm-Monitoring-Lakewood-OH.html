Arlo Pro 2 also has an impressive Night Vision function. It is equipped with infrared lenses that allow the camera to record videos even in complete darkness. It has about 25 feet of presence in the evening. As such, even if someone get into your home in complete darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your smartphone app. The only concern here is that the taped footage will be white and black and a little dark so you may not have the ability to see information clearly.</p>
<p>If you hold down the panic or emergency alarm buttons on the burglar alarm touchpad for 1 to 3 seconds, an alarm is transmitted to the ADT monitoring center, and emergency services are dispatched right away.

Homeowners picking a system should search for a reputable, respectable company. Many of the best security companies have remained in the home security business for years, long before the idea of self-monitored systems even existed.
