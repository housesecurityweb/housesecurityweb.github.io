<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you desire to get out of the agreement you have to pay 75% of the contract.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really annoying. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, since apparently they auto renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a written not by mail.

No duress choice: A professionally monitored system often features a duress PIN.

<p>The City does not refund license costs to alarm-monitoring companies when customers cancel their service. Specific alarm companies might have their own policies relating to refunds. The City is enabling subscribers to switch monitoring companies without charging the new monitoring company for a license cost that was paid within the fiscal year by the previous monitoring company. Be prepared to supply your new company with the paperwork of prior payment.</p>
