As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
