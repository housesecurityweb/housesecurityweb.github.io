<p>Different kinds of CCTV cameras. Alarm monitoring has various technical aspects depending on the system that you have. Your system control board is the heart of the whole security system.

<p>For a lot of commercial CCTV systems, structured cabling run throughout the walls, connecting your security cameras to the server or NVR, will be a vital element.

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible culprits are less most likely to dedicate criminal activity if they think they are being viewed or have a greater danger of being apprehended. This is likewise known as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011).
