These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room.

As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
