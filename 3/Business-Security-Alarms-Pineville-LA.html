<p>However for everybody who loves ADT, it seems like there's someone who's had an awful experience. Part of that is since ADT has more clients than most brands-- which implies it has more possibilities to encounter problems. However part of it is the method ADT sells its equipment.

We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over two months. Scout is really easy to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones.
