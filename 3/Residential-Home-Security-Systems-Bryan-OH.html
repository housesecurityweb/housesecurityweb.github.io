<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
