Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly progressed into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the outcome of security systems.</p>

We value that the company continues to iterate and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza.

<p>The NVR removes these issues, since it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>
