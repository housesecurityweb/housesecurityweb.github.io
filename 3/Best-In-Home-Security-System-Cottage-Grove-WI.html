<p>When it comes to home security systems, Houston locals have options. You can choose a nationally acknowledged brand name or opt for a local company. Both supply comparable offerings, however if you think there's a chance you may leave the Houston area in the future, you might be much better off partnering with a national brand that you can take with you when you move. Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera combined with a 2,000-lumen light in an entirely wire-free component. (You can pump that illuminate to 3,000 lumens by combining the battery with outdoor cabling). It likewise has a number of the Arlo Pro 3's functions, including 2K recording, two-way audio, and a built-in siren.

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you don't commit to a three-year contract.</p>
