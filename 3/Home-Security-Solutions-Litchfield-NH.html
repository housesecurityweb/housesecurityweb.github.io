<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
