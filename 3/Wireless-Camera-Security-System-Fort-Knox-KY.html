<p>One category where SimpliSafe has gotten somewhat dissatisfying reviews is customer service.

Just like any technology, using cameras is by no means a substitute for good old-fashioned ground work. The camera video offers additional leads in an investigation and aids in securing witness cooperation. The video footage acts as an enhance to - but not a replacement for - eyewitness proof in the courtroom.</p>
