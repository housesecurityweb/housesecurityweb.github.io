For this factor, these cameras are ideal for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are unable to work optimally. Not only does Ring (now owned by Amazon) make video doorbells, it makes security cameras too: here we're chosen the wireless, battery powered model, but there is a wired variation also if you do not wish to fret about ever having to charge the batteries.</p>
<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't suggest it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and requiring time off from work. Contacting a service technician costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert deal with the task and do not mind spending the extra money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>

<p>Throughout our testing, this compact camera tape-recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom worked for taking a closer look. We particularly like this camera's wide, 180-degree field of vision, because you're less most likely to get a blind spot any place you set it up.
