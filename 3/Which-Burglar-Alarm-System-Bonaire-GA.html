<p>Nest is pricier than a lot of other DIY home security systems, but it's a good choice if you wish to monitor your system yourself. Nest's mobile app is one of the most instinctive and easy to use that we've seen. Set one phone as the Viewer and one as the Camera, and take pleasure in basic security. Vivint's equipment is the most technologically advanced of all the security companies on our list. Its clever home panel lets the system discover your habits, so it understands when to show up the heat or dim the lights based upon your regular and choices. And Vivint includes complete access to its mobile app with every package-- a perk that a lot of companies make you pay for.</p>

With among these, your tape-recorded video is sent to a remote server and kept for an established time-- typically anywhere from 24 hr to a week-- and then deleted to make area for new videos.
