This is also called the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance method, which argues that opportunities to upset can be decreased by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and decreasing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Wired: Each camera is connected to a recording system, which in turn is connected to a router. Installation can be complicated - especially if your home has actually already been built - so make certain to consult with an expert before handling the task yourself.

Wired systems are a much better alternative because they can support more cameras if you have a big home or property that needs extensive coverage.</p>
