<p>Wired: Each camera is connected to a recording system, which in turn is connected to a router. Installation can be complicated - particularly if your home has currently been developed - so be sure to seek advice from an expert before taking on the job yourself. Wired home security cameras send data through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're also not prone to disturbance such as cellular and radio frequencies.

<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light abilities have a shutter that permits more light to get in the camera's sensing unit. The more light that is permitted to enter the camera the brighter the image will be. Nevertheless, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image look fuzzy. To fight this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital noise reduction Some security cameras now come with infrared light that is invisible to the human eye but can be picked up by a security camera's sensing unit.</p>
