<p>The XT2's case is weatherproof, so you can stick it either inside your home or outside, and comes with a hassle-free mounting bracket. While not tops, the 1080p video is records is good for the rate, and best of all, it features complimentary cloud storage (up to two hours in overall). Since Blink (and Ring) are owned by Amazon, the Blink app likewise has a connection to Ring's Next-door neighbors app, where you can see a feed of other incidents in your neighborhood, and post videos from your Blink camera. Blink's app is fairly robust, and while it does not have all the bells and whistles of Arlo's cameras, this sub-$ 100 has plenty of features for the rate.</p>
