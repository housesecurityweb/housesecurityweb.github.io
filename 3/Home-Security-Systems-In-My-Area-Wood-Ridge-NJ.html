The Spot can record approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were typically missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline.

IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
