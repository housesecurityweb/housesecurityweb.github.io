<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to use also (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve.

If you don't already have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are range concerns.</p>
