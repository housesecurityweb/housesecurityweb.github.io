<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm in Alabama</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
