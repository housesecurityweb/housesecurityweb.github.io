Conditions such as outdoor or indoor area and the presence or absence of light will play a huge function in deciding which camera is best suited for the task at hand. A number of other designs were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to connect to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).
