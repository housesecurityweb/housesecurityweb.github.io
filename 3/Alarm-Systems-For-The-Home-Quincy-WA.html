<p>I described that all we would require to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, we believe this problem is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>
