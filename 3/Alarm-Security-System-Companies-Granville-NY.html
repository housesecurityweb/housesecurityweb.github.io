<p>Audio and video confirmation strategies utilize microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image pictures.

<p>No. Self-monitoring does not mean Do It Yourself installation. There are numerous companies that use self-monitoring and expert installation. Remember there will be a one-time installation fee. The charge will differ depending upon the complexity of the system. There are also companies that offer support hotlines for people attempting to install a system on their own, so if a concern turns up a house owner can get answers without looking at a manual for hours.</p>
