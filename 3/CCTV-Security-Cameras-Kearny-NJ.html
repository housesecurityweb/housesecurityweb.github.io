<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
