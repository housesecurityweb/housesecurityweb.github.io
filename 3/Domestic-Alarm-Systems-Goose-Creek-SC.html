<p>so say you have a camera that somebody can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I advise to have actually cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras present an apparent indication for anybody who passes by that they are being tape-recorded on CCTV and this can be an excellent deterrent of theft and criminal offense. Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a bigger area such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>
<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
