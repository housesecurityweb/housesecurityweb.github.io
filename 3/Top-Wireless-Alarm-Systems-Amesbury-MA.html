<p>Lots of wireless home security systems are can be set up by the homeowner and have a simple setup process. But security systems that need a phone line connection are generally more advanced and need professional installation by a specialist. That said, we actually liked Brinks' straightforward bundle choices. You'll have 3 options to pick from, which vary from basic intrusion protection to full-on intrusion protection + home automation + video surveillance. We truly enjoyed using Brinks' video features, and we like how their top-tier package comes with an HD video doorbell for good measure.</p>
