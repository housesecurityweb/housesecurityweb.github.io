<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a priority.</p>

<p>Think about it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low rate of forty dollars?
