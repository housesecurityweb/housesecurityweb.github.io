<p>The simple answer is yes. You get strong equipment and reputable expert monitoring from both types of security companies when it comes to the essentials of home security.

<p>A societal agreement about how cameras should be utilized is necessary, however in the end we are a country of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution uses some protection versus video searches performed by the police, there are presently no general, legally enforceable guidelines to limit personal privacy intrusions and protect against abuse of CCTV systems. Rules are needed to develop a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and the length of time are they maintained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the guidelines would be validated and enforced; and what penalties would use to lawbreakers.</p>

These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service arrangement. Paying for the equipment in advance supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you want.</p>
