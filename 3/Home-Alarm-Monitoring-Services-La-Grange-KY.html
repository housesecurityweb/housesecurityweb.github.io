<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, must provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use).
