These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many authorities departments offer numerous "totally free" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, although the cost to react is substantial right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers call into question the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 totally free false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
