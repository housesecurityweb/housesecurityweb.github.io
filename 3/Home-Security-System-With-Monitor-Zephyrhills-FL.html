<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the whole family will love. It's a neat technique, and one that works pretty well, but just as soon as you've configured the remainder of the settings.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you walk by.
