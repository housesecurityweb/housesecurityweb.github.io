<h3>Home Security Monitoring in Mississippi</h3>
<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the smart home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and wise thermostat for the cost of equipment and $10 additional a month. If you can't afford the additional equipment, we still like Vivint's basic bundle. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
<p>Nest is more expensive than a lot of other Do It Yourself home security systems, however it's a good choice if you wish to monitor your system yourself. Nest's mobile app is among the most intuitive and easy to use that we have actually seen. Set one phone as the Audience and one as the Camera, and enjoy easy security. Vivint's equipment is the most technologically advanced of all the security companies on our list. Its smart home panel lets the system discover your routines, so it knows when to show up the heat or dim the lights based upon your routine and choices. And Vivint includes full access to its mobile app with every package-- a perk that a lot of companies make you spend for.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
