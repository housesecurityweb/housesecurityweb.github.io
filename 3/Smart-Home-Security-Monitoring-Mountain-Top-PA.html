<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
