<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions.

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level.

The gadget collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based on details about the temperature level distinctions. Due to the fact that items are hardly ever precisely the very same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can find them, and they will look like unique in a thermal image.</p>
