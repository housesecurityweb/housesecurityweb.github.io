It can be controlled remotely through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control panel (also referred to as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capability to pair with other smart gadgets and can not be managed from another location. Likewise a local alarm will not call the authorities; it merely sets off an audible siren to inform people nearby.</p>

Do It Yourself: Many people take pleasure in the do-it-yourself element of clever alarms, because they can select the technology and parts that they feel best fulfills their requirements. These days, there's a lot to consider when putting together a video surveillance system. And the first question on many people's minds is Do I opt for conventional analog cameras, or IP network cameras?" There are cons and pros to both options.

<p>Network cameras can be used for very cheap surveillance services (needing one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to change entire CCTV installations (cameras become network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs, and CCTV keeps track of become computer systems with TFT screens and specialised software application.
