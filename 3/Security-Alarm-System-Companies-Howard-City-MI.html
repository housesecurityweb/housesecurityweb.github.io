<p>ASIN: B01DJ1FTTS Foscam R2 2MP 1080P HD Wireless Security Camera (Black)I bought the Foscam R2 2MP 1080P HD Wireless Security Camara - black about one week back, my asian purpose was to keep my child's crying noticed easily with this camera, and it works fantastic till now.

The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
