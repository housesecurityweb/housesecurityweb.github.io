<p>Houston homeowners have alternatives when it comes to home security systems. You can pick a nationally acknowledged brand or go with a local company. Both supply similar offerings, however if you believe there's a chance you might leave the Houston location in the future, you may be better off partnering with a nationwide brand name that you can take with you when you move. Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera integrated with a 2,000-lumen light in a completely wire-free component. (You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by integrating the battery with outdoor cabling).
