<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you want the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the clever home tech.

<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It requires an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensors work well.

Employing a specialist costs more, however for those who choose to let a professional deal with the job and do not mind investing the additional money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
<p>For the a lot of part, I believe that Philips Shade's outdoor lights are overpriced and actually only worth it if you want to splurge That said, I truly liked the Philips Hue Outdoor Sensor, which you can get for less than $50. Stick it up anywhere you like outside, and it'll track motion, temperature and ambient light conditions.
