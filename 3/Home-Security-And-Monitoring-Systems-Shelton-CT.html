In long-term testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
