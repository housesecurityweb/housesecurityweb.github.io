Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to overlook objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
