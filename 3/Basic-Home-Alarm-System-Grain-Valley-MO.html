<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
