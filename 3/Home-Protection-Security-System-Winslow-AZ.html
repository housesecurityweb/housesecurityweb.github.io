<p>DITEK's alarm system surge protectors safeguard your security system versus short-term rises that can go into through A/C power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. It's not just about security from theft, either. Adam Kostecki, the senior assistant vice president of digital solutions and development at Amica, advises sensing units that concentrate on things you wouldn't otherwise see, like leakage sensing units or freeze sensors.

<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
