The first task is the alert of a siren, this allows for everyone in your area consisting of the house owners or company owner to know that an intruder has been found. The second task is flashing outdoor lights. Not all burglar alarms have flashing outdoor lights but the most common burglar alarms and some of the advanced ones do.
