I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since obviously they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds between videos.</p>
<p>One place that provides an interesting insight into how China has rapidly become a surveillance superpower is Ecuador.

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but practically all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is tape-recording. The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>

Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more pricey for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
