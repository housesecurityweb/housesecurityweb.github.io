<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone device or in tandem with the rest of your security system. It activates the doorbell camera when someone calls the doorbell. That video can go to your smart device, computer system, or to a screen inside your home. Doorbell cameras belong to many home automated systems and offer an extra layer of protection. These cameras often come with two-way talk, night vision, and a built-in motion sensor. Just like any security camera, take a look at the video resolution and field of view.
