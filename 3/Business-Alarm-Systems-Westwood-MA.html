<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
