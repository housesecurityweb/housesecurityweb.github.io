I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter informs, for example. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively steep price: $5 per month ($50 annually) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 each year) for thirty days of video history.  For each extra camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the preliminary cost.

Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or false alarm charges, and supply physical proof like camera video footage or a damaged window to require police action.</p>
