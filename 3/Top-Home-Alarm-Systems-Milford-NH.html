<h3>Domestic Alarm Systems in Milford NH</h3>
<p>If I liked the appearance of the Nest, then I like the Hive View's design - definitely the most visually pleasing camera on this list.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
