As infrastructure, sensing units and electrical wiring need to be placed inside the walls, which involves drilling and connecting sensors to low-voltage wires, so there's professional labor to consider. Uninstalling, reinstalling a system and moving is specifically problematic and normally inadvisable, due to the fact that it means putting old hardware in a new location.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers great 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable level of sensitivity setting.
