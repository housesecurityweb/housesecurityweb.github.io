Meet our favorite option for home monitoring and protection: the Piper nv Smart Home Security System with Night Vision and a 180-degree Video Camera. The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's left to the company's considerate, well-informed specialists.

Wyze's recently released Complete Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not recommend that for home security because if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
