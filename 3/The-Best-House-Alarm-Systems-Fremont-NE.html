<p>All of the self-installed systems I tested can work without a monitoring strategy, but then they are restricted to simply sounding an alarm inside your home and in many cases, pressing a notification to your phone and do not have the ability to immediately dispatch authorities or emergency personnel.

It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
