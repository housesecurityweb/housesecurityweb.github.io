IP cameras are much more effective than analog cameras, usually shooting video footage of in between 1 megapixel and 5 megapixels. That produces incredibly clear image quality, specifically compared to the more grainy analog video footage, which runs around one-half of a megapixel. IP cameras generally have a larger field of view than analog cameras.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
