(You can protect that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension kit, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more pricey total per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't advise it since its battery-saving regimens can disrupt efficiency.</p>
