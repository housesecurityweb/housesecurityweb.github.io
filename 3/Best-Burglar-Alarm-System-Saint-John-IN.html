<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to save and how long you plan to keep taped video. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
