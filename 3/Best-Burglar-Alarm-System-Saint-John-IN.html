<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to save and how long you plan to keep taped video.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
