<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

I am really pleased with this product! The cameras were better than expected and I like the convenience of having the ability to check it from my phone while I'm not home.</p>
