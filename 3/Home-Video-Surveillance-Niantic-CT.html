<h3>Domestic Burglar Alarm Systems Niantic CT 06357</h3>
<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to disregard objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
