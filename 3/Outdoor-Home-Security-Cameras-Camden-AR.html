<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and definitely enjoy it. Great clearness. I wished to set up viewing on my mobile phone but had a couple concerns that the tech addressed with ease. I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly advise this company.

A majority of the grievances center around misinformation concerning the necessary three year contract. In fact, the majority of clients were not aware they were making such a long term dedication. This, paired with the severe charge for premature cancellation-100% of the staying balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may give some time out in selecting Protect America as their home security service.</p>
