<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of everything, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes good sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and smart thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 extra a month.

Overall, however, whatever did what it was expected to do. View our scores and reviews, and search our purchasing guide to find the very best security camera for your home.</p>
