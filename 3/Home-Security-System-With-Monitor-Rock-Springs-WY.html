<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated.

Sometimes you don't even need to hardwire them, depending on which model you choose. As with any security system, the more equipment you add, the pricier it gets. Which cost jumps a lot when you include clever cameras to any Blue system. We like that you can choose from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every smart camera Blue deals is $200.</p>
