<p>We didn't consider alarm that needed expert installation. Pro-installed systems generally cost more, usage equipment similar to that of DIY systems, come with normally difficult and long agreements, and often depend on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they use little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated separately and do not suggest for most people.</p>

It is necessary to find an outdoor security camera that just records when motion is identified to cut electrical energy costs or battery use.
