<p>In the modern day, with our rampant internet usage, we've ended up being surprisingly lackadaisical in our approach to home security. Simply believe how much information you hand out when you do a basic online grocery order: your name, your address, the kind of things you buy, what times you'll be around (and, by extension, what times you'll be out). You might even offer directions on how to enter your building. As recently as 10 years earlier, customers did not have access to technology that let them handle their own home security systems. Smart alarm systems altered that. Originally, conventional security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a central station, generally a home alarm company. The consumer paid month-to-month charges.</p>
<p>We love that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision option, but the white and black variation can in fact be clearer and provide you higher-quality video footage. This isn't really a huge deal thinking about the Argus 2's cost and all its other features-- but for the record, stick with black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo wise service.
