<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power.</p>
