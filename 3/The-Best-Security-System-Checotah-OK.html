We believe that's expensive.</p>

<p>In spite of having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its limited, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug.

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving regimens can disrupt performance.</p>
