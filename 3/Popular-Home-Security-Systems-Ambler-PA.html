<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients understand that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
