<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<h2>Why Security Cameras Are Important Liberty Lake</h2>

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
