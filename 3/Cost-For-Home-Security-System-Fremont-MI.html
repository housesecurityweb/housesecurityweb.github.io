<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective offenders are less most likely to dedicate criminal offense if they think they are being seen or have a higher threat of being apprehended. This is also referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity prevention method, which argues that chances to offend can be reduced by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of an offender being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
