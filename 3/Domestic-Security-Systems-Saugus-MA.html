For one, cameras must prevent or mask inappropriate views of personal areas, such as backyards and windows of bed rooms or bathrooms.

<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, because it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>
