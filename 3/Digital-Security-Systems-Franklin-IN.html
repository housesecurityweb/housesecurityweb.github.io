A number of other designs were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of up to 90 seconds in between videos.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
