<p>In 2015, EFF found out that more than a hundred ALPR cameras were exposed online, often with absolutely open Web pages available by anyone with a web browser. In many cases, anybody could open a web browser window and view a camera's live video stream and witness the plate records in real time.

<p>Bullet cameras are among the two most common CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, giving them their name and a distinctive look. This appearance is identifiable to almost everyone and thus acts as a deterrent to unwanted people. The hope is burglars and criminals go somewhere else rather if security cameras are visible. That being said, bullet cameras are more susceptible to vandalism because of their apparent look. Furthermore, the shape of the camera is perfect for concentrating on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, however requires numerous cameras if a user needs to see multiple set views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work indoors or outdoors. They include a small lip on the end of the camera that includes weather protection and lowers glare.</p>
<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
