In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop.

<p>Following behind the Ultra 4K is the brand new Arlo Pro 3, which provides a comparable plan but with 2K video rather.
