<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and a sensational worth. It gets an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does provide a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is found. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The Arlo Q is compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT (If This Then That), SmartThings, and Wink. And if the included 7 days of free storage isn't enough, an Arlo Smart membership includes 30 days of tape-recording for one camera, person detection, and motion zones for $3 each month.
