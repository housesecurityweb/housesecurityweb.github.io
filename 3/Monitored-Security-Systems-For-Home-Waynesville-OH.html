<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
