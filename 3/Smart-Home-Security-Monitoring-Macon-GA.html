<p>The Wyze Cam can likewise record video to the cloud, however the complimentary account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes.

Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, with no gaps in between.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
