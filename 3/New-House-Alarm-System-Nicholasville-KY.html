<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>
