<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, need to provide a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a regular monthly cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to effectively identify motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it might leave you with recording spaces throughout essential security occasions. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd suggest one of our top choices, however the Arlo is fantastic for checking in on household and family pets-- or stray felines sliding around your yard.</p>
