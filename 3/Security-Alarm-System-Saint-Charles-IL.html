<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place.

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we don't recommend it because its battery-saving routines can interrupt efficiency.</p>
