<p>All About Security provides expert, trustworthy alarm monitoring services for homes and services throughout the higher Indianapolis area. Figure 1-1 depicts an example of a CCTV installation that keeps track of select locations of protection. The first installation was designed and developed for the separate parking facility. This implementation consisted of numerous set position cameras on each floor of the parking lot, stairwells, and exits, all linked directly to a primary control system (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is a basic device for handling the input and output of video feeds through the coax cable televisions. Ancillary energies and gadgets can offer simple integration of some alarms, however this innovation has actually restricted capabilities and an intricate integration procedure.</p>

<p>Typically a wired system can be confused with local alarms. However, the 2 are significantly different.

A local system does not have the capability to couple with other smart devices and can not be controlled remotely. Likewise a local alarm will not contact the authorities; it merely triggers an audible siren to alert individuals close by.</p>
