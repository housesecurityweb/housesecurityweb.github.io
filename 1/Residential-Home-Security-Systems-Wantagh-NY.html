Monitored systems rely on professionals to look for triggered alarms, contact system owners, and dispatch emergency services. Unmonitored security systems aren't connected to a monitoring center. Instead, they generally connect with an app that the system owner expect suspicious activity.</p>

Even though it does not have the widest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the couple of cameras on our list that come with a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug.
