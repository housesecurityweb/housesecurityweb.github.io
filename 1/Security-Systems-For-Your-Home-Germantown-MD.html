<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. If catching footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Storage: We limited our testing to cameras with cloud storage, whether it's totally free or for a regular monthly charge. If somebody notifications the camera, local storage on a microSD card is likewise nice to have; just understand that in your area stored video can be stolen.
