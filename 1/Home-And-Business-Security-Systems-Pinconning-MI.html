<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, should provide at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more readily available for a monthly charge ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to correctly detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it may leave you with taping gaps during crucial security occasions. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd suggest one of our top picks, but the Arlo is terrific for checking in on household and animals-- or roaming felines slipping around your backyard.</p>
