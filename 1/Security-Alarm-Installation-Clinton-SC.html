<p>One classification where SimpliSafe has actually gotten rather dissatisfying reviews is client service. Many users are not really delighted with the way dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for incorrect alarms due to the fact that they can frequently lead to surcharges. Furthermore, the general viewpoint is that the company's customer service is not really valuable when it concerns repairing issues and repeating use concerns.
