<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches use only to NVR systems, but they eliminated other elements that would be needed for a DVR system, like extra power sources and the BNC cable televisions used to link cameras to the DVR. Rather, when you link a PoE switch to your network, you have actually got a source of power and a method of sending information to your NVR all in one bundle.
