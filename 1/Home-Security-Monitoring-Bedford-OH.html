<p>The NVR removes these problems, because it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.

The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
