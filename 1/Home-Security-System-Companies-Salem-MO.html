<p>Before you choose a video surveillance camera, make sure you understand exactly what you need to study. Conditions such as indoor or outdoor area and the existence or lack of light will play a huge function in choosing which camera is best matched for the task at hand. Numerous other models were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
