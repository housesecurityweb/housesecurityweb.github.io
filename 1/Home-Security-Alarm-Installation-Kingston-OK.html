It ships with four smooth and white bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor use. They're equipped with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and wise IR to supply up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our testing that the app periodically forgot cameras which then required to be re-added.</p>
<p>I have this camera linked to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>See this video to see the Windows software application used to from another location view HD security cameras. There's numerous wireless security cameras to choose from and we barely scratched the surface area of what sort of cameras are out there. Still, we think that the Arlo Pro 3 is a standout item with its 100% wire-free operation. Its remarkable video quality makes it tough for the competition to maintain. While it's more pricey than most other cameras, the total quality of the Arlo Pro 3 helps make up the difference in price.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to use as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you don't already have an Arlo camera or 2 in location, you're going to require to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are range problems.</p>
