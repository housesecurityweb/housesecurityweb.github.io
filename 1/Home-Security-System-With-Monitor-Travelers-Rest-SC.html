Cellular systems utilize cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours up until the electric service is restored. Landline systems use conventional phone lines to interact with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they typically have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on created to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that knows the secrets can read all the traffic.</p>
