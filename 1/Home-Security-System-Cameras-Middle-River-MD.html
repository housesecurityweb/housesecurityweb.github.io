<p>Our security panels are user-friendly, simple to tailor and highly dependable. And built-in Wi-Fi makes it easy to synch with the ADT mobile app. Dependability. The main specialty that wired security companies have is that the systems can be more dependable than a wireless system.

For example, the system informs you that a window or door has actually been opened. If the system is armed and a problem is identified, the system is also programmed to notify us. Fast Response Monitoring Services (the award winning company that keeps track of all of our systems) can see specifically what area is jeopardized such as a window or door. We initially call the home to validate that a problem exists. If the alarm was triggered unintentionally, we note the occasion and take no additional action.
