<p>One classification where SimpliSafe has actually gotten rather dissatisfying reviews is customer care. The majority of users are not really pleased with the method dispatch calls from the monitoring system function for incorrect alarms because they can often result in surcharges. Moreover, the general opinion is that the company's client service is not very valuable when it concerns repeating and fixing problems usage problems.

That also conserves battery life, however it may leave you with tape-recording spaces during essential security occasions.
