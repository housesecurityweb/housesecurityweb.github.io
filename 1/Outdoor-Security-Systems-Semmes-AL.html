<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
