<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, need to offer at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers 7 days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to effectively detect motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it may leave you with recording spaces during important security occasions. If home security is your main issue, we 'd advise one of our top choices, but the Arlo is great for signing in on family and pets-- or roaming felines slipping around your backyard.</p>
