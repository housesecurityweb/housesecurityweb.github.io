<p>Though Vivint's sensing units are wireless, the control panel does need to be installed by a connected and expert to a power source. It uses cellular innovation to communicate with the monitoring center, so it checks both wireless" boxes, however keep in mind that a specialist will drill small holes to install the control board on your wall.
