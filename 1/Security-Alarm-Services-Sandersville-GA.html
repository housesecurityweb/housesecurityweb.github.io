<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
