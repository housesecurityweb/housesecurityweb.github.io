Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to overlook objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires.
