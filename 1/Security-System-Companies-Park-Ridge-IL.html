<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling appointments and taking time off from work.
