Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
