<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal worth. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
