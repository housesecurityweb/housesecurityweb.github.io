<p>Video cameras, or closed-circuit television (CCTV), are becoming a more and more prevalent feature of American life.

A 2005 study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the worry of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>
