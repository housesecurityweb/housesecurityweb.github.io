We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (as much as 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, typically buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>

<p>In industrial plants, CCTV equipment might be utilized to observe parts of a process from a main control room, for instance when the environment is not suitable for human beings.
