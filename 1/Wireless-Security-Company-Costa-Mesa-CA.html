<h3>Home Security Monitoring Service in California</h3>
<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Learning permits somebody to find what they are searching for without needing to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Picture a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are trying to find in the taped video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we simply type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.

<p>All of the self-installed systems I checked can work without a monitoring plan, but then they are restricted to simply sounding an alarm inside your home and in some cases, pressing a notice to your phone and lack the capability to instantly dispatch authorities or emergency personnel. Given that phone batteries pass away and cellular service varies depending on where you are, a push alert is usually a bad method of triaging when your home security system has been tripped.</p>
