<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a fantastic security camera and an incredible worth. It receives an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests.

Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.

Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The smartphone app has 3 modes of operation-- Standby, Home, and Away. You hear a tiny chirping sound whenever the entry sensors get triggered when you place the gadget on Standby mode.

These are all relatively smart modes, however they can not be altered. You can't alter the level of sensitivity of the sensing units or schedule them. This also leaves you susceptible to incorrect alarms, specifically if you have small kids or pets in your home. Some individuals prefer the lack of customizability due to the fact that it makes the entire device exceptionally simple to use. But it can also be a significant limitation for some.</p>
