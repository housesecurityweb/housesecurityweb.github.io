<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for watching on your kids and animals, however if you're worried about security, you don't want to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action. That's why we advise the corded variation of the Logitech Circle 2, which provides constant recording, sharp 1080p video, and a day's worth of cloud storage for free, with alternatives for more by means of subscription. Even though it doesn't have the best operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that included a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cable rather thick, so you can't really run it through a window opening.</p>
