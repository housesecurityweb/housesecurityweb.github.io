<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

This is likewise referred to as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011).
