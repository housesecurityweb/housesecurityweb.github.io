<p>Arlo declares that you should have the ability to get four to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term testing of the camera, we generally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic.
