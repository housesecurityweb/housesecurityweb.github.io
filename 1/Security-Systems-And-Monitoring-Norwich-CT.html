<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect things that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
