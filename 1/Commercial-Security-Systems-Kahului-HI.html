<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
