<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out mobile phone informs with that details when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced smart home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
