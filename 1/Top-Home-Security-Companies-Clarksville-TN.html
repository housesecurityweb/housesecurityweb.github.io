Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent.
