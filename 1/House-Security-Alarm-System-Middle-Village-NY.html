<h2>What Does Battery Life Have To Do With Security Cameras Middle Village</h2>
<p>As the name recommends, this alarm is a starter set". So it's basically expected that it will not have actually extended customizability or a large range of features.

<p>The Wyze Webcam can also catch video to the cloud, however the totally free account is restricted to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to record again, which suggests you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently released Total Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, with no spaces in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not suggest that for home security because if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
