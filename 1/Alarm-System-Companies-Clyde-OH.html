Wyze's recently introduced Total Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, with no gaps in between.

I would not advise it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may prefer to install their own systems to avoid scheduling consultations and taking time off from work.

<p>CR's take: The Amazon Cloud Web Cam (Key Edition) is an all-around terrific camera with strong ratings for information privacy and security, getting a rating of Great in the former. It also uses reputable video quality and response speed. The Cloud Webcam's features consist of a rolling 24 hr of free cloud video storage for video set off by the camera detecting motion (video that captures movement, rather than dead air) and voice control through Amazon Alexa.

Without expert monitoring, you'll be responsible for monitoring your own home, normally with a mobile app and activity alerts.</p>
