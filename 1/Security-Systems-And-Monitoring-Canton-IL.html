<h2>A Better Tool For Monitoring And Ensuring Hand Hygiene Adherence Canton</h2>
<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the agreement you need to pay 75% of the agreement.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since apparently they auto renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too expensive, and not terrific.</p>

<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
