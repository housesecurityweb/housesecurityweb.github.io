<p>Bullet cameras are among the two most typical CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and an unique appearance. This look is recognizable to almost everybody and therefore functions as a deterrent to unwanted individuals. The hope is trespassers and wrongdoers go in other places instead if security cameras are noticeable.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor.

However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
