The use of advanced systems by police and other public security authorities is particularly unpleasant in a democratic society.

<p>Indoor cameras are excellent for keeping an eye on your kids and family pets, however if you're worried about security, you do not wish to run the risk of missing a second of the action.

Despite the fact that it doesn't have the largest operating temperature level variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug.
