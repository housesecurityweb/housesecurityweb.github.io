In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
