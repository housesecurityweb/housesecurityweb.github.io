<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and an incredible value. It gets an Excellent rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is found. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we checked, and it offers two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And regardless of having an appealing rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
