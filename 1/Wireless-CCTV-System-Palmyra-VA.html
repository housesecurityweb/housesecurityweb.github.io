<p>The Wyze Web cam can likewise record video to the cloud, however the free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape again, which means you may be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently introduced Complete Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not suggest that for home security since if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
