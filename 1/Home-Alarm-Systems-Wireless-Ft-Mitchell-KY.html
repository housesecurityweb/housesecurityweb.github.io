Now, the majority of security systems include a variety of components, such as a base station, security camera, motion, glass, and entry break sensors, a keypad, and essential fobs, to name a few elements.

Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, wise lock, etc.), I want to ensure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
