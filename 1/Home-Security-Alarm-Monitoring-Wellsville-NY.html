Many security companies, whether they're DIY, professionally set up, professionally monitored, or self-monitored, will offer guidance if you're puzzled about what to select.

<p>SimpliSafe includes an abnormally long trial duration where customers can test out their system while safeguarded by a full money-back warranty.
