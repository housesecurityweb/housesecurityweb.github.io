<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
