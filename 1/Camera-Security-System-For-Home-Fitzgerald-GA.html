<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers.
