I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that obviously they automobile restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.

<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and once again in client reviews, and it delivers a crisp photo as much as 32 feet. And although the app and software are easy to deal with, it's a little a letdown that you can't integrate this camera with any clever home hubs or gizmos.

Tech is supposed to make our lives much easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function with no frustration.</p>
