<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services providing benefit, comfort and fulfillment to every client and are devoted to fulfilling our customer's needs with integrity, honesty, enthusiasm and exceptional service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering a number of years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems available today.

The argument is that anyone can smell the traffic applies to wired networks too, where system administrators and possible hackers have access to the links and can check out the traffic. Likewise, anyone knowing the secrets for an encrypted wireless network can access to the information being transferred over the network.</p>
