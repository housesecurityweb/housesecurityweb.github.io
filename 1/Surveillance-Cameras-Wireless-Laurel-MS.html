<p>A lot of security cameras can be used both inside your home and outdoors. They normally have the exact same functions like night vision or remote watching, however they differ in resilience. Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and in many cases, completely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance ranking are the most long lasting. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices due to the fact that their style enables minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection rather than motion detection.
