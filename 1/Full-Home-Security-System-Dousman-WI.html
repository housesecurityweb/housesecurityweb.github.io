<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Basically, wireless security systems rely on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to receive sensing units needed to manage your equipment including enabling, disabling and sending you immediate alerts.
