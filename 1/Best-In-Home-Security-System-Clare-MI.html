<p>Some home insurance coverage providers require you to have an alarm system as part of their policy. However, alarms needed by insurance companies should adhere to the European Standard EN 50131 and must be installed by an NSI or SSAIB accredited installer. All of the clever alarms on the marketplace currently do not abide by the European Standard, and as they're created to be self-installed, they won't be accepted by your insurance provider.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
