<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder prior to buying.</p>

When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those individuals and will send smartphone informs with that information when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION).
