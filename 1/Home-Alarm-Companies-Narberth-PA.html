<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
