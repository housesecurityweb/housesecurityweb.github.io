These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see in the evening. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
