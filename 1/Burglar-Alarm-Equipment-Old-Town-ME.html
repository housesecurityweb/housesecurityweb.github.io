It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's much better than a lot of cameras that are four times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost two years of day, night and use images have actually always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We have actually seen it highlight mice, cars, and moths.</p>

Another wireless camera setup, this Zosi 8-channel system records in Full HD and features four weatherproof cameras that can be affixed outside to walls.

In addition to the traditional aspects of a home security system (including sensing units, lights, and cameras), you'll also need to install a center station to help assist in communication in between your security system and mobile phone or computer.</p>
