<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, fraud, and theft. Meet our favorite option for home monitoring and protection: the Piper nv Smart Home Security System with Night Vision and a 180-degree Camera. The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's left to the company's polite, knowledgeable specialists. Our tester felt that the pro who installed his Vivint system was respectful, prompt, and truthful (even decreasing his expense after recognizing they didn't need to install one camera).</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, there's a big distinction between the latest wise home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, however the charm of the current smart items, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you need (or can afford) as well as integrate whatever to work with other wise gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to produce an all-encompassing clever home, not just a burglar alarm.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
