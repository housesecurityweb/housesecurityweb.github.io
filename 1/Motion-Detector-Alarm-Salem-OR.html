<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Previously, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security option (although we enjoyed it as a pet web cam ). It has actually given that been improved and now matches our top picks due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and numerous smart-home combination options. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other picks, it has a minimal field of view, and Wyze says it plans to do away with person detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>
