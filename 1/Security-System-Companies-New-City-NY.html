Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and permits that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A typical misconception is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free.
