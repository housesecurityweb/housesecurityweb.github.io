<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
