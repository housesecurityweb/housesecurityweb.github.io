<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
