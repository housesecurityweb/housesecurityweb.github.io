Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
