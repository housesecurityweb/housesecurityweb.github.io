<h3>Home Intruder Alarm System Wonder Lake IL 60097</h3>
<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore things that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
