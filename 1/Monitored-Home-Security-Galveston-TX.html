The density of access points can even be an issue - there are a restricted variety of channels offered, and they partially overlap. Each channel can deal with numerous networks, but locations with many private wireless networks (for instance, apartment building), the limited number of Wi-Fi radio channels may cause sluggishness and other problems.</p>

Since whatever is just stuck onto the wall and not hardwired, removing cameras, detectors, and other parts of a wireless security system and putting them up in a new place takes minutes, not days.
