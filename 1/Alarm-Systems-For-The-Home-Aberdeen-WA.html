<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to save and the length of time you plan to keep taped video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>

<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. It triggers the doorbell camera when somebody rings the doorbell. That video can go to your mobile phone, computer, or to a screen inside your home. Doorbell cameras become part of lots of home automated systems and offer an additional layer of protection. These cameras frequently come with two-way talk, night vision, and a built-in motion sensing unit. As with any security camera, have a look at the video resolution and field of vision.
