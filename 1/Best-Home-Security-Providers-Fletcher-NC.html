Even though it does not have the largest operating temperature variety (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the few cameras on our list that featured a really weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't truly run it through a window opening.</p>
<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating advanced wise home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, including creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. However the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you don't commit to a three-year contract.</p>
