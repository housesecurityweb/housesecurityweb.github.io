<p>Base stations are the center of a security system, using WiFi and wireless innovation to link all the various sensors, cameras, and other system elements.

<p>A taut wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, accommodating advanced wise home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is expensive, extra sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include fire alarms or camera backups-- is also pricey if you don't dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
