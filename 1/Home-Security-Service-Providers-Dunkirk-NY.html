<p>So why do not we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see so many growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security area. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer service experience varies extensively depending upon the dealership you opt for.
