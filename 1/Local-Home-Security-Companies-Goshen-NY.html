<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function.

As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
