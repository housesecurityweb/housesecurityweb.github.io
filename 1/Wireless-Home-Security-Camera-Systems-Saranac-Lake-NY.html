IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR.

There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
