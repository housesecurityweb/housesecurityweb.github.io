Hello there Rebeca, thanks for this blog site. I am so grateful that you have pointed out about wise home integration Just last week I was offered lot of cameras to install by a home owner, unfortunately the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems. So we needed to buy new cameras.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

The more light that is permitted to go into the camera the brighter the image will be. However, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image look fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come equipped with 2D and 3D digital sound decrease Some security cameras now include infrared light that is invisible to the human eye however can be picked up by a security camera's sensor.</p>
