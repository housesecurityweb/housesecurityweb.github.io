<h3>Camera Security System Sudbury MA 01776</h3>
<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
