It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run indoors or inside - you get a great deal of flexibility from this little gadget. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of vision, the motion detection, and the detachable magnetic base which is easy to install.</p>

<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't suggest it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time may prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and taking time off from work. Employing a technician costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert manage the job and don't mind investing the additional money, expert installation is the way to go.</p>

<p>We downloaded each camera's app to an iPhone 7, an iPad, and a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie, when possible. The cameras spent weeks guarding our front door, notifying us to good friends, member of the family, delivery individuals, and even the milkman. As soon as we got a good enough look at those friendly faces, we slanted the entire collection outward for another two weeks to see what sort of outcomes we would get when the cameras dealt with your house throughout the street, which is approximately 50 feet away.</p>
<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage alternative and others do not.
