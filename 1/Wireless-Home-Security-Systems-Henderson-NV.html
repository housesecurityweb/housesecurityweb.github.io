<h3>Alarm System Security in Henderson NV</h3>
<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording video in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

<h3>Monitored Home Security Systems in Nevada</h3>
<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
<p>When we checked the Ring alarm equipment, it worked well. The door sensing units are a bit big, which can be inconvenient for doors with molded or small frames. (To neutralize this issue, Ring's released a slim magnet, which can be purchased separately.) And the $199 five-piece kit does not have adequate equipment to protect most homes completely. In general, however, everything did what it was supposed to do. View our reviews and ratings, and browse our purchasing guide to discover the very best security camera for your home.</p>
