<p>A subsidiary of Amazon, Ring's Alarm security package is quick to install and easy to use. Aside from a new "Works with Ring" program to bring suitable clever locks and other third-party gizmos into the fold, there's nothing all that ingenious about it, though Amazon Alexa users will value the two-way voice function, that they can equip and disarm the system using voice commands and that they can use Ring's sensing units to activate Amazon Alexa regimens.</p>
