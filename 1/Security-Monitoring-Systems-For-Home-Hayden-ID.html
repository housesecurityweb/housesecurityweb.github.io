<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It requires an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well. I would not recommend it though.

Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even use the kind of cameras they are offering to the public, and there is a good reason why.</p>
