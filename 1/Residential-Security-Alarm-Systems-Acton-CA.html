<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensing units work well. I would not advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and taking time off from work. Calling in a professional costs more, however for those who choose to let an expert handle the job and do not mind investing the extra money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>

We're unable to compare Alder to other providers relating to price, however Alder does offer the fundamentals and more for protecting your home, and our company believe that contributes to the provider's general value.</p>
