<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
