<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
