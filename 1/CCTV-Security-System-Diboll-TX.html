<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
