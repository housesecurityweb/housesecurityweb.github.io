If you are far from the location, an alert can be sent to you instantly, to notify you of the scenario.</p>

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to get out of the agreement you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly frustrating. Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since obviously they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, method too costly, and not fantastic.</p>
