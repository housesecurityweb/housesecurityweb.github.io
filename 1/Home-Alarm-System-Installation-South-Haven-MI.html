Once again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, since obviously they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.  ADT is a problem, method too costly, and not fantastic.</p>
