<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
