Some alarm serve a single purpose of burglary protection; mix systems supply both fire and intrusion protection. Intrusion alarm may likewise be integrated with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to automatically tape the activities of intruders, and may interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors.

In Home mode, a loud 93dB alarm is activated whenever the entry sensors are set off. Lastly, in Away mode, both the motion sensing units and entry sensing units are active. These are all fairly intelligent modes, however they can not be altered. You can't alter the sensitivity of the sensors or arrange them. This also leaves you vulnerable to false alarms, particularly if you have small kids or family pets in your home.
