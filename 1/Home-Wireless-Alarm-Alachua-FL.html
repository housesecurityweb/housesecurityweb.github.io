<p>The only method to keep communication really secure is to use end-to-end encryption For example, when accessing a web bank, one would almost always use strong file encryption from the web internet browser and all the way to the bank - hence it shouldn't be dangerous to do banking over an unencrypted wireless network. The argument is that anyone can smell the traffic applies to wired networks too, where system administrators and possible hackers have access to the links and can check out the traffic. Likewise, anyone knowing the keys for an encrypted wireless network can get to the data being transferred over the network.</p>
