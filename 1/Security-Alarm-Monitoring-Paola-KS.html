<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to neglect things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
