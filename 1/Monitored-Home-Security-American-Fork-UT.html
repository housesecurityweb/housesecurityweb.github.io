<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
