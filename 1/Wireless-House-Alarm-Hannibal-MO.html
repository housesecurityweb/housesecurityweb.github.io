<p>Maximus Smart Security Light: If you want a subtle security camera, the Maximus Smart Security Light fits the expense. The camera's not particularly remarkable by itself, however its porchlight outside will look much better than your other options.

Both also lack individual detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to reduce false signals.</p>

<p>A societal agreement about how cameras must be used is important, however in the end we are a nation of laws and rights that have their root in law. While the Fourth Change to the United States Constitution provides some protection against video searches performed by the police, there are presently no general, legally enforceable guidelines to limit privacy intrusions and protect versus abuse of CCTV systems.
