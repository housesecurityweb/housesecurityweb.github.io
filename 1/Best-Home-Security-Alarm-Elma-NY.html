<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a number of companies use "complimentary monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Many insurer offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of cops departments provide a number of "free" false alarms prior to imposing any fine, even though the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers cast doubt on the suitability of the present trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or four complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, since they provide no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>

This likewise depends on the provider, but you can anticipate signing an agreement with suppliers who require professional installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some contracts might cover up to 60 months or 5 years.
