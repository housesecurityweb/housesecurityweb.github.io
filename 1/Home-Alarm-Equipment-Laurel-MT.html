<p>CCTV cameras are placed in areas where they are believed to be most effective, which normally consists of highly inhabited towns, city centers, car parks, or different other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Considered that the positioning of these cameras is really essential, the crime patterns in areas of interest are generally studied for amount of times to identify criminal activity hotspots where cameras could possibly be put.

<p>Power-over-Ethernet changes apply only to NVR systems, but they cut out other elements that would be needed for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cable televisions used to connect cameras to the DVR.

When choosing which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system, the biggest factor to consider. The next factor to consider is how most likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
