<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users must reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not think that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing recommendation.</p>
<p>We like that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision alternative, but the white and black version can actually be clearer and offer you higher-quality video footage.

With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. However the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the aid of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
