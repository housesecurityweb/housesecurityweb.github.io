<p>Arlo declares that you should be able to get 4 to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.

<p>Wireless security cameras being evaluated in a Customer Reports lab. If you do come across a home intrusion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am a little dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB.
