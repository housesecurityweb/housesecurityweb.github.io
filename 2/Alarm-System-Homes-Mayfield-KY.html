<h3>Security Camera System in Mayfield KY</h3>
<p>Primarily, it's tough to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are four times the price. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after practically 2 years of day, night and use images have actually always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we came across when testing the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion spotted. We've seen it highlight moths, vehicles, and mice.</p>
