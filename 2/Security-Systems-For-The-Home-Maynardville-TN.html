<p>Arlo declares that you should be able to get 4 to 6 months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras established outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it needed a complete charge once a month.</p>
