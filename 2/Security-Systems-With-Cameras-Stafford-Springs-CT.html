IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
