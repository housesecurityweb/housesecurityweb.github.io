<p>All individuals with alarm systems safeguarding a facility in the City of Fredericksburg must have a valid alarm authorization. The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single interface provides extra information that may never have actually been possible previously, such as notice of an employee, by name and recognition number, getting in the structure. An image of that employee exists on screen for confirmation (confirming it's not a stolen ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, guaranteeing no tailgating occurs.</p>

<p>Now let's analyze why consumer-grade cameras are often bad night vision performers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it needs a source of light to illuminate the area listed below it. Unfortunately, the night vision illuminators that feature consumer cameras are created for brief range just and are of a fixed brightness. This suggests they generally over-expose what neighbors in a scene, causing people and items to appear burnt out" and without any detail. So much for attempting to recognize the bad guys. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness automatically to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear properly exposed and completely information. If a camera can not record and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image during the day and in the evening, it has limited effectiveness.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network.

Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
