<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the required action.</p>
