If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent.
