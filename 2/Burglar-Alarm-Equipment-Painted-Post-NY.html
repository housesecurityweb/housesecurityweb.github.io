<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
