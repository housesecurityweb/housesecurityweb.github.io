<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
