For one, cameras must avoid or mask unsuitable views of personal areas, such as yards and windows of bed rooms or bathrooms. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of vision, the typical motion alerts, and a 90+ dB alarm that is most likely to frighten any approaching burglar before they have actually got too far into your home.

(We think this is a more valuable function if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's excellent that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Cam.</p>
