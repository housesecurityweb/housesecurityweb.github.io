The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
