<p>With an expertly monitored system, when a smoke or intrusion alarm is set off, a representative will first attempt to reach you by means of the two-way control panel prior to calling your noted phone number. The representative will call 911 to dispatch an emergency responder to your home if you stop working to respond. The good thing about expertly installed systems is you don't need to lift a finger; after you have actually put your order a technician will come to your home, set everything up for you, and show you how the system works.
