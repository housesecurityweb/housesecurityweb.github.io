<p>All persons with alarm systems protecting a property in the City of Fredericksburg need to have a legitimate alarm authorization. The combination of digital video surveillance and access control is part of the natural merging of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface uses extra details that may never have been possible in the past, such as notice of a staff member, by name and identification number, entering the structure.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, due to the fact that it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR.

There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
