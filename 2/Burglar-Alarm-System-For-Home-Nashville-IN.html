This isn't really a big offer considering the Argus 2's rate and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo wise service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the aid of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
