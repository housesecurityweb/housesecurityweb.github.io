<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
