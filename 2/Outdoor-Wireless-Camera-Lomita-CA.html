<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies offer "totally free monitoring services" for the first few months. Numerous insurance companies offer discounts on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments use a number of "free" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, although the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four totally free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, since they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>

In addition, watch on your camera logs to see when they have actually been accessed.
