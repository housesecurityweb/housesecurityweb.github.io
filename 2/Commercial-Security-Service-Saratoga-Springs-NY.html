We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza.

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.

Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by.
