<p>How do you avoid crime? While the capability to peer into lawbreakers' ideas and anticipate bad habits isn't a reality just yet, there are a number of tried-and-true techniques to deter theft and burglary. Amongst the most popular are placing valuables out of sight and ensuring your home or business constantly looks occupied, even when you're away.

For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is tape-recorded.
