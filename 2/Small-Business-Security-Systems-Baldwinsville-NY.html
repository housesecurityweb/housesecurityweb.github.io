<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using benefit, comfort and satisfaction to every customer and are devoted to satisfying our client's needs with stability, sincerity, enthusiasm and outstanding service. Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, spanning several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet economical systems available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
