In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
