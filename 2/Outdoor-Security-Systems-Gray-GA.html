Connect Interactive may have a lot of equipment, however it's not always the most attractive stuff out there. Plus, Link Interactive's not as well-known of a trademark name as, state, ADT.

<p>Home likewise offers a Smart Security Set that consists of just one entry sensing unit and one motion detector. Since that limits the number of entrances you can protect, we think Residence works best for smaller spaces like an apartment or dormitory.

If you're going to buy something on top of a company's basic home security packages, be definitely sure you can afford it.

<p>SmartThings was likewise a past nominee. However, it requires a good deal of effort to get the system to operate as a home security system.

Likewise, the app remains hard to browse, though they are moving users to a newer app called 'SmartThings Link' which has potential. Just like Vizzini's overuse of inconceivable" in The Princess Bride, home security companies like to toss around the word wireless" pretty easily. We get it.
