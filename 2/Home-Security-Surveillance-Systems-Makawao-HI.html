So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Really irritating. Once again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year commitment. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR.
