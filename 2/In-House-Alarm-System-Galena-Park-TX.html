When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
