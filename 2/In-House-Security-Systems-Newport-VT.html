<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly.
