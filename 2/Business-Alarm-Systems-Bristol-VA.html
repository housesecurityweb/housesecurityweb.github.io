<p>A tight wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
