<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any customer in the network that understands the keys can read all the traffic.</p>

Even if you pay an expert to install your system, it will still be less costly than a monitored system due to the fact that the majority of the cost is in the monitoring service, rather than the equipment.
