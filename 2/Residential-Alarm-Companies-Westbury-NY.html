<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set quantity of time, typically one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which permit you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of dedicating to a long-lasting plan, are becoming more common.

<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was developed for house owners. It must be installed by a professional alarm installation team and, once installed, is hard to move from one location to another.

The group will be able to recycle the existing wiring if you've currently set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system.
