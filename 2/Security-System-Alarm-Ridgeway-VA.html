<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage choice and others do not. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded. The systems with video storage normally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage choice. A local storage option conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This option is normally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is usually a paid service and the variety of hours it will store will depend on how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>
