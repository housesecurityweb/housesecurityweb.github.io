<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, should offer at least a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of free cloud storage (with more readily available for a regular monthly fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to correctly spot motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also conserves battery life, but it may leave you with recording spaces throughout important security occasions. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd advise one of our top picks, however the Arlo is great for checking in on household and animals-- or roaming felines slipping around your backyard.</p>
