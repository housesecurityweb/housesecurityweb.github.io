However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips.

The install is magnetic, but it's strong, so you can easily connect the camera and move it up, down, and everywhere in between.</p>

Also, the Blink does not give you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
