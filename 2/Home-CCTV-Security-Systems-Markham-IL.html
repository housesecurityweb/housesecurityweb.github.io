<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
