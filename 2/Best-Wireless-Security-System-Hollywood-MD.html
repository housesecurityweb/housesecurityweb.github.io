<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to ignore things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
