<h3>Best Home Security Alarm System in Florida</h3>
<p>Home security systems are an excellent way (and a wise option) to help protect homes, people, and belongings from trespassers. Traditionally, these systems were needed to be hardwired to existing electric and telephone lines within the home to work appropriately. Today, advanced options are offered with the introduction of wireless security systems that provide lots of benefits to property owners that can not be matched with the original technology requirements.</p>
<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is consisted of alarms, sensors, cameras, and numerous detectors all linked to a primary control panel by means of radio signals. For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage area for video, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>
<p>The Nest Web cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the exact same subscription design and same app as the original Nest Web cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed individual detection, a brighter image, an automatic close-up tracking function (which follows a person around the viewing area), much better audio, a more powerful install, and a wider operating temperature variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit). It's also more tamper-proof than any of our other picks, but that included security makes for a trickier installation procedure, and it costs practically twice the rate of the Nest Cam Outdoor.</p>
<p>Up until now so normal. Things begin to get really interesting with the Nest's facial recognition system. If the camera spots a face it doesn't identify, it will send out an alert and image to your phone, allowing you to consider that person the twice. If it's somebody getting up to no good, the camera will follow their movements and save the timestamp, so you can easily find it in the future. And, of course, you can phone 999 while they're still in your house.</p>
