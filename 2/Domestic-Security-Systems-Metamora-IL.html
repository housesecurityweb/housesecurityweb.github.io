<h3>Cheap Home Security in Illinois</h3>

<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well. I would not advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may choose to install their own systems to avoid scheduling visits and requiring time off from work. Contacting a professional costs more, but for those who choose to let an expert manage the task and don't mind spending the extra money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
