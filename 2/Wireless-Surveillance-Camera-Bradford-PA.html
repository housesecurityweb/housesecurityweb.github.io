If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any gaps in between.

<p>A tight wire border security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to identify any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect objects that apply percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
