<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise nice metal construction.

Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
