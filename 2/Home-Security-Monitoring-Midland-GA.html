<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Terrific clarity. I wanted to establish viewing on my cellular phone however had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease.

The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. However, those functions come at a comparatively steep price: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 each year) for 30 days of video history.

Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
