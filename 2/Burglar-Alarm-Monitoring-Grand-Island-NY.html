<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, because it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you desire the best of whatever, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the clever home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automated door lock and smart thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 additional a month. If you can't afford the extra equipment, we still like Vivint's basic plan. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
<p>The Amcrest UltraHD 4K Dome Camera is only one of Amcrest's 4K video models, all of which give you super high-quality video resolution.
