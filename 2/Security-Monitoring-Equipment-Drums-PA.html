<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to use as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or more in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can indicate there are range problems.</p>
