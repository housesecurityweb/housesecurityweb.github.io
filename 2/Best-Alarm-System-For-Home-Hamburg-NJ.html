<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>

Circuit alarm systems do an exceptional task of protecting the boundary of your home or business and detecting any breaches in the door or windows.
