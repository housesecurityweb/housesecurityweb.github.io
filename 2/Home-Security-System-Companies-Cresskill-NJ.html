<p>Although the Ring Alarm security sets and monitoring strategies are probably the least expensive out there, Ring cameras and lights run from about $40 to $200 each. It's easy to see how that can build up if you want to include a few bonus. However, it does not play too with other gadgets and items, like those with Z-Wave and Zigbee compatibility, and you can't automate particular commands through IFTTT (If This Then That) yet. Just as with the redesigned equipment, this home automation update puts it in league with competitors-- especially those with Do It Yourself installation.</p>
