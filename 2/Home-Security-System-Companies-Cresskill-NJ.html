<p>Although the Ring Alarm security sets and monitoring strategies are probably the least expensive out there, Ring cameras and lights run from about $40 to $200 each. It's easy to see how that can build up if you want to include a few bonus. However, it does not play too with other gadgets and items, like those with Z-Wave and Zigbee compatibility, and you can't automate particular commands through IFTTT (If This Then That) yet.
