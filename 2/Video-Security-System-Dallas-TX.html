<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

Calling in a specialist costs more, however for those who choose to let an expert handle the job and do not mind investing the extra money, expert installation is the method to go.</p>
