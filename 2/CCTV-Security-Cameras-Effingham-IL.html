<p>so say you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I recommend to have cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras provide an obvious sign for anybody who goes by that they are being tape-recorded on CCTV and this can be a great deterrent of theft and criminal activity. Whereas dome cameras are smaller sized and more discreet. These compact cameras are perfect for monitoring a bigger location such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>
<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
