<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, because it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds pricey, but it's not so much when you consider that a live person is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras find suspicious activity. That person at Deep Guard's center can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, however it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
