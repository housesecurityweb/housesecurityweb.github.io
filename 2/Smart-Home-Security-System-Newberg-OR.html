Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, including smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. However the Secure is costly, additional sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you don't commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
