<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

With wireless security, your cameras, sensors, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to get sensors required to manage your equipment including enabling, disabling and sending you immediate notifies. Once a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, web, or e-mail website.

Likewise, anybody knowing the keys for an encrypted wireless network can access to the data being transferred over the network.</p>

That is to say, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it pertains to isolating the images of an active event about to occur.</p>
