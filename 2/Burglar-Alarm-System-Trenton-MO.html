<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
