This is also known as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that opportunities to upset can be decreased by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being apprehended, increasing the effort to devote the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and minimizing provocations that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the transgressor needs to be aware of the included surveillance for it to accomplish its wanted result.</p>
<p>CCTV cameras are better at capturing wrongdoers after they have committed a criminal activity, rather than having the ability to stop a criminal offense in development. Somebody needs to be actively watching the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to try to find criminal activity prior to it happens.
