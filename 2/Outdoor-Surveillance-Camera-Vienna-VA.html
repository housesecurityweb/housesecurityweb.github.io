<p>We downloaded each camera's app to an iPhone 7, an iPad, and a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie, when possible. The cameras spent weeks guarding our front door, signaling us to good friends, member of the family, delivery individuals, and even the milkman. Once we got a good enough look at those friendly faces, we slanted the whole collection outside for another 2 weeks to see what sort of results we would get when the cameras faced the house across the street, which is around 50 feet away.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp photo approximately 32 feet.

A great deal of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but couple of make things as basic as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
