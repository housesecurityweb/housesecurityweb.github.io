Not only is the Arlo fast to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Just a couple decades back, the home security market was dominated by a couple of big names providing costly, rigid plans with little versatility and hostile, long-lasting agreements. Systems were restricted to a couple wired motion sensing units linked to a keypad control board and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has all changed.</p>
