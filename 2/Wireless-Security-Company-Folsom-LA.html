The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems available today.

If there are 3 select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single set camera can only view one. This develops a one in three opportunity of capturing a specific occurrence on video (either live or recorded). The command center likewise consisted of a computer system designated for filing occurrence reports online. These can be accessed by management personnel at a later date from a database via the computer system network.</p>
