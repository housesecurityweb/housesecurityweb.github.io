<p>The security systems above are our favorites, but we discovered three more companies you might be interested in if you have actually some specialized needs. No duress alternative: A professionally monitored system often features a duress PIN. The homeowner can turn off the alarm using the duress PIN if an intruder requires a property owner to deactivate the system. While the alarm is off, the duress code acts as a secret signal to the monitoring company to send assistance instantly. Self-monitoring systems don't have this choice.</p>

When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, could merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends potential culprits are less most likely to commit crime if they believe they are being viewed or have a greater threat of being nabbed.
