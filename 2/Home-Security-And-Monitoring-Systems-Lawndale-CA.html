<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
