<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
