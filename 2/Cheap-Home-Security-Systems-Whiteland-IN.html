We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was likewise pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of up to 90 seconds between videos.</p>
