If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
