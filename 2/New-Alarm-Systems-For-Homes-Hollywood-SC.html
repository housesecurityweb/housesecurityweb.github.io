<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests prospective offenders are less most likely to commit criminal activity if they think they are being seen or have a higher danger of being captured. This is also referred to as the reasonable option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be minimized by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of an offender being captured, increasing the effort to commit the crime, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and decreasing provocations that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
