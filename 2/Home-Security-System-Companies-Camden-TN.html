This indicates they usually over-expose what is nearby in a scene, causing items and people to appear burnt out" and with no detail. A lot for trying to identify the bad people. Commercial cameras, however, often are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness immediately to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear appropriately exposed and completely information.
