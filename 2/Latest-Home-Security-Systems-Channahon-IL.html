<p>DITEK's alarm system surge protectors secure your security system against transient rises that can enter through A/C power lines, telephone lines and remote notification zones.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked.
