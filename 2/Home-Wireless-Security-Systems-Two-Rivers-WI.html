<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more wiring.

<p>The genuine reason cameras are usually released is to minimize much pettier criminal offenses. But it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the issue have actually found that they have not reduced crime. "As soon as the criminal offense and offense figures were adjusted to take account of the basic down trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular classifications but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had decreased crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>
