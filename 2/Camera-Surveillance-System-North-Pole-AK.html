Wyze's recently released Total Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not recommend that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
