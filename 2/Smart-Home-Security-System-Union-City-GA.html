<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
