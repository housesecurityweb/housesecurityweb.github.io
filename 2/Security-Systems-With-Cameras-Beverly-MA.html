<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
