Both the original Home system and the House Iota are compatible with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we evaluated that likewise works with HomeKit.

<p>One of the top home security suppliers since going into the business in 1992, Protect America supplies service for numerous thousands of customers around the United States and Canada.

Regrettably, there are some drawbacks to Secure America suggested by their low C- ranking from BBB.

This, combined with the extreme penalty for premature cancellation-100% of the staying balance plus spending for all of the equipment-may give some time out in picking Protect America as their home security service.</p>

There are at least 11 different smart home brands that work with Ring, consisting of Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Ecolink, Yale, Schlage, and GE.
