When she got an alarm notice while on holiday, she had no chance of assessing whether her home had been gotten into or if her feline had actually managed to journey the sensing unit. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
