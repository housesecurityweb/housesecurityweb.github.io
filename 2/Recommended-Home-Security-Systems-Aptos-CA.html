<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
<p>Samsung SmartThings is among the most customizable self monitored alarm since you get to select which sensing units and devices you desire (and the number of), and which you don't.
