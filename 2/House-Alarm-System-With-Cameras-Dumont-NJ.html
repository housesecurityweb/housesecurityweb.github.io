The primary difference is that the wired system couple with the other clever home gadgets to create a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control board (likewise known as the alarm panel).

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively common. If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
