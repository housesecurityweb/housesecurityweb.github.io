<h3>Home Security System Review in Tennessee</h3>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
