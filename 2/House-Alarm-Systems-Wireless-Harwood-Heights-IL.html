<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

<p>Arlo declares that you should have the ability to get four to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term testing of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that fluctuated in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic.
