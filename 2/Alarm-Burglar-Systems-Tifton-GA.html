By ordinance, just incorrect alarms triggered by hurricanes, twisters, earthquake or other disastrous events, undergo appeal. Alarms activated by electrical storms, thunder, hail, or abrupt changes in temperature do not satisfy the requirements for waiver of false alarm fees. Alarms activated by legal but unexpected entry to the home, i.e. kids returning home, visitors, neighbors looking after the home while you are on vacation and shipment males do not fulfill the requirement for waiver.</p>
