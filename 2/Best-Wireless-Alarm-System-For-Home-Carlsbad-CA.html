<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge.
