We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
