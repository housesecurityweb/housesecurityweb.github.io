This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR.

<p>Simply purchased a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Great clearness. I wanted to establish viewing on my mobile phone however had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease.
