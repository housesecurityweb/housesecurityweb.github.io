<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
